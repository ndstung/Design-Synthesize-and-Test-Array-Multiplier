# Systolic Array Multiplier Project

This repository contains the design, synthesis, and testing of a systolic array multiplier using Vitis HLS and FPGA deployment. The project begins with a 4x4 systolic array multiplier and scales to handle larger matrices (16x16, 32x32, and 64x64), offering high-performance and resource-efficient solutions for matrix multiplication.

## Project Overview

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in fields like signal processing, machine learning, and scientific computation. Systolic arrays provide a structured and parallelized approach, minimizing memory access and enabling high throughput. This project explores:

- The design and operation of systolic array multipliers.
- Implementation of 4x4, 16x16, 32x32, and 64x64 configurations.
- Optimization using Vitis HLS for efficient FPGA deployment.

## Key Features

1. **4x4 Systolic Array Design**: 
   - Efficiently computes matrix multiplication using multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations across a network of processing elements (PEs).
   - Localized data flow minimizes memory bottlenecks.

2. **Scalability to Larger Sizes**:
   - Parameterized design supports 16x16, 32x32, and 64x64 matrices.
   - Optimized memory and resource management ensure scalability without significant performance loss.

3. **Vitis HLS Implementation**:
   - Uses C/C++ descriptions with loop pipelining and unrolling to optimize performance.
   - Reduces latency and increases throughput through parallelism.

4. **PPA Analysis**:
   - Evaluates power, performance, and area (PPA) trade-offs for each configuration.
   - Demonstrates efficient resource utilization and high operating frequency.

## Architecture Overview

The systolic array architecture arranges PEs in a grid structure:
- **Input Flow**: Matrix A is fed row-wise, and Matrix B is fed column-wise.
- **Data Processing**: Each PE computes partial products and accumulates results.
- **Output**: Results flow through the array to produce the final matrix.
